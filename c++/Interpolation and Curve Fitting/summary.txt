Keypoints:

1) Interpolation methods are the basis for many other procedures that you will study in
this course, such as numerical integration and differentiation; (數值積分與微分之基
礎)

2) they are behind the ways that we use to solve ordinary and partial-differential
equations; (常微分與偏微分方程式數值求解方法之準備)

3) they demonstrate important theory about polynomials and the accuracy of numerical
methods; and (建立可茲以描述數值方法準確度之重要理論)

4) they are one of the more important ways that curves are drawn on your computer
screen. (在電腦螢幕上繪製曲線的重要方式)

2. B-Spline Curves
3. Creating a B-Spline Surface
4. Least-Squares Polynomials (最小誤差平方多項式)
